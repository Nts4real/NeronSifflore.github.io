ðŸ“š I hold a BSc (Hons) Economics from the University of Nottingham.

ðŸ”¬ My research involves using various microeconometrics tools to uncover the effects of different government policies and developmental interventions on the accumulation of human capital. 

I am also interested in understanding how persuasion by leaders shapes the behaviour and beliefs of the masses. My fields of interest include development economics, labour economics, financial economics, and applied microeconometrics.
