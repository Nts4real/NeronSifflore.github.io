title: "The educational and labour market effects of the 1976 Universal Primary Education Program in Nigeria"

excerpt: 'In 1976, Nigeria introduced its free education programme that abolished fees in all public primary schools. Using data collected 33 years after the scheme’s introduction, I estimate its impacts on educational attainment, learning, and employability. I find the programme increased men’s educational attainment by one year but had no measurable effect on their learning; it also increased the probability of a woman completing  primary school by 36.8 percent. I find no evidence that the programme improved employability. If anything, It seems to have reduced male participation in agriculture, but I find no evidence of increased participation in skilled jobs'
